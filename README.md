# gqlgen Starter with Authentication and Authorization using Keycloak

This project gives an example of how to use [99designs/gqlgen][1] to create a GraphQL - Webservice with implented authentication and authorization using [Keycloak][2].
I have also integrated concepts used in [OscarYuen/go-graphql-starter][3], which was designed for use with [graph-gophers/graphql-go][4]. Unfortunately that library missed 
a few features that I needed which is why I switched to gqlgen.

The purpose of this repository is to help others get started and receive valuable feedback to improve this starter pack. Pull Requests are welcome as well.

## Roadmap

- [x] Docker Support
- [ ] Docker Compose File
- [x] Use reflex for hot-reload
- [x] Integrate gqlgen
- [ ] Use go-bindata to merge schema files
- [ ] Add Authentication using Keycloak
- [ ] Add Authorization using Keycloak
- [ ] Add Registration
- [ ] Use GORM with Postgres to save additional data
- [ ] Use Redis to save session data
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Show example usage of subscription

## Requirements

- Golang
- Docker

## Usage

### docker run

You can either use the prepared gqlgen - image I made or build it on your own. To edit gqlgen-files
use docker volumes and bind /app
```
docker run -v PROJECT_PATH:/app schartey/gqlgen
# or
docker build . --tag=YOUR-TAG
docker run -v PROJECT_PATH:/app YOUR-TAG
```

The image will generate the gql-files automatically at first start.
Afterwards it will update generated files according to your changes and run the server.
I use [reflex][5] for hot-reload. It tracks changes on all .go files except those generated by gqlgen. 

### Development

To start developing just follow the guide on the gqlgen github page. There shouldn't be any difference.
Here is a short starter:

- Create your own schema.graphql in gqlgen folder
- Write your resolvers
- Adjust your gqlgen.yml
- Write your own packages

Each of these steps should cause reflex to hot-reload and by that regenerating needed gqlgen data.

### Basic Image

As mentioned before there is a prepared image which can be used to develop with gqlgen. This image will be tagged in
git with gqlgen-starter. Further development of the actual gqlgen-auth-starter project will continiously be merged to master.

## Known Issues

- The current version of gqlgen supports directives, but is not yet bug free. If you encounter the error:
```
unable to parse config: yaml: unmarshal errors:
    line 18: key "deprecated" already set in map
    line 20: key "include" already set in map
    line 22: key "skip" already set in map
```
you have to remove (comment) the directives settings in gqlgen.yaml.

- Reflex does not support Windows, therefor hot-reload will not work on this platform.
